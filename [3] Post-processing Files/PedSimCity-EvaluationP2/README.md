## PedSimCity-Evaluation -  A workflow to evaluate the output of PedSimCity
 
This repository includes the necessary data and code to reproduce the analysis reported in *Modelling the effect of landmarks on pedestrian dynamics in urban environments*, published in *Computers, Environment and Urban Systems*.

The notebooks *EmpiricalABM_Clustering* and *EmpiricalABM_Evaluation* support the analysis described in the paper *Empirical characterization of agentsâ€™ spatial behavior in pedestrian movement simulation*, published in the *Journal of Environmental Psychology*. Here an empirical based agent based model for the simulation of pedestrian movement in cities is presented. 
Empirical data is employed to regulate the route choice behavior of the agents, while allowing for heterogeneity in the agent population.

To run the jupyter notebooks you need to install the library [cityImage](https://github.com/g-filomena/cityImage) and its dependicies.
